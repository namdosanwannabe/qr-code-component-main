## My process

- write the html code

- design the website (mobile-first)

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to make a responsive website using the media query in css

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

### Continued development

I'm still having a hard time in making the website a responsive one and still confused how to use the grid and flex. That's why I will learn this by watching a tutorial.
